A Services Booking App (ie restaurant, haircuts, dentist):

An app that businesses/service providers can sign up for, users can then reserve a spot for that service. 
Using geolocation the service can be automatically allocated or the reservation freed up. 

The platform sends a notification if the user is too far to travel to that establishment for their reservation. 
Users arriving at the designated location can present a qr code that can be scanned to confirm that the user is present and authorized.
